### Project Description
Sock Tracker is a quirky, gamified mobile app designed to solve the age-old mystery of disappearing socks. Users can upload photos of their sock pairs, track them through laundry cycles, and earn streaks for keeping pairs intact. If a sock goes missing, the app connects users to a community of fellow sock-trackers to help find matches. Combining utility, humor, and social engagement, Sock Tracker turns a mundane chore into a playful challenge‚Äîbecause laundry should never be lonely.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every laundry day, socks mysteriously vanish into the void‚Äînever to be seen again. Scientists call it ‚Äúspontaneous sock evaporation.‚Äù We call it unacceptable. Billions of socks are lost annually (probably), and humanity has done nothing about it. Until now.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
Introducing Sock Tracker‚Äîa gloriously over-engineered app that lets you catalog your socks, track them through laundry cycles, and earn streaks for keeping pairs together. Lost a sock? No worries. Our Sock Match Community is here to help you find its long-lost twin. It‚Äôs part game, part social network, and entirely unnecessary‚Äîbut you‚Äôll never lose a sock in silence again.
